<center><h3>Program 1: Artificial Intelligence</h3></center>
The artificial intelligence is a behavior exhibited by machines and systems, similar to that of human beings. In
the case of a computer system, its artificially intelligent ability to mimic human behavior stems
from its collection and analysis of past activities and data.
With each new piece of information, the machine can make corrections to itself so that previous errors wonâ€™t
resurface and make any necessary adjustments to handle new inputs. This approach enables AI systems to
perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decisionmaking, and translation between different languages.
<h4>What is artificial intelligence?</h4>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines
capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
<h4>What are the four types of artificial intelligence?</h4></p>
 <ol type="1">
 <li>Reactive Machines </li>
 <li> Limited Memory</li>
 <li>Theory of Mind</li>
 <li> Self-Awareness</li>
 </ol>
<h4>What are examples of artificial intelligence?</h4>
 <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
 <li>Siri, Alexa and other smart assistants </li>
 <li>Self-driving cars </li>
 <li>Robo-advisors</li>
 <li>Conversational bots </li>

<center><h3>Program 2:Computer Animation</h3></center>
Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers.
It is a subfield of computer graphics and animation.
Increasingly it is created by means of 3D computer graphics, though 2D computer graphics are still widely used
for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster real-time rendering needs.
